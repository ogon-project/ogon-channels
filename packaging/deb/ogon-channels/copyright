 If you modify any files with these exceptions, you may extend these exceptions
 to your version of the file(s), but you are not obligated to do so.
 If you do not wish to do so, delete this statement from your version.

 1. OpenSSL Exception
 
 Permission is hereby granted to copy, modify, propagate, and distribute a work
 formed by combining OpenSSL with ogon, or a work derivative of such a
 combination, even if such copying, modification, propagation, or distribution
 would otherwise violate the terms of the AGPL. You must comply with the AGPL
 in all respects for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.
 
 2. No-Communication Exception
 
 If you modify ogon and the covered work has no means of communicating an
 offer to provide the corresponding source to the users interacting with it
 remotely through a computer network, you may comply with this requirement set
